This is a project in development and a part of the [Software development 1] course on Faculty of Information Technologies in Mostar, BiH.

This project is created using .NETCore(c#).       
One of the tasks was to also create a part of the app using Angular.

"eKorpa" is an webApp that provides sales services for clothing. 
Users can search for different types of brands, types of clothing , sort by price and etc.
Also, users can create and account and sell an item online or buy an item.
